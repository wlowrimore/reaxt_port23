        I am a Software Engineer with just under one year of professional
        experience in Full Stack development. I have a passion for the Front
        End, yet keep a firm understanding of, and respect for Back End
        programming and logic.

        Integrating an OHIF (Open Health Imaging Foundation) Imaging Platform
        with the React 18 Library was one of my favorite tasks and
        accomplishments. Though it was extremely challenging, the outcome was
        very rewarding.

        My background is firmly anchored in the arts, particularly music. I
        beleive that my years as a professional recording artist, performer,
        writer, and producer give me a solid foundation built from my experience
        with collaboration and creative thinking. These attributes translate
        fluently into my role as a Software Engineer.
