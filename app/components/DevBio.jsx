        I attended and graduated from Vanderbilt University coding boot camp
        (2021 - 2022), completing the full-stack web development course. Working
        in the virtual classroom, I learned the fundamentals of React.js,
        Database Theory, MySQL, Command Line, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and more.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-4">
        Upon completion of the boot camp, I continued my education through
        online courses, pair coding, and even a full-time role as Junior
        Software Engineer under the direct supervision of my mentor, and CTO of
        a Boulder, CO based software engineering firm.
      </p>
      <p className="pb-4">
        I continue to study, code, and create everyday. Although my
        certification is in full stack web development, I thrive in the
        front-end environment.
